Welcome! This repository is my personal collection of Python projects, coding challenges, and exercises. It primarily documents my progress through **Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"**. This space serves as a living journal of my journey to master Python, track my improvement, and build a portfolio of my skills.
