# Day 52: Instagram Follower Bot

Welcome to my log for Day 52! Todayâ€™s project was to build an **Instagram Follower Bot**. The strategy is simple: find a popular account with a similar audience to the one you want to build, and then systematically follow their followers. The idea is that a percentage of these users will notice the follow and follow you back, helping to grow your account's presence.

This was an excellent Selenium challenge that involved dealing with dynamically loaded content, scrolling inside a modal pop-up, and handling various interruptions.

### 1. Project Goal: The InstaFollower Bot
The goal was to create a bot that could:
1.  Log in to a specified Instagram account.
2.  Navigate to the page of a target account (e.g., a competitor or influencer in the same niche).
3.  Open the list of that account's followers.
4.  Scroll through the list to load more users.
5.  Click the "Follow" button for each user in the list.

The entire process was structured within an `InstaFollower` class to keep the code organized.

### 2. Step 1: Logging into Instagram
The first task was automating the login process.
-   **Navigation:** The bot opens the Instagram login page.
-   **Dismissing Pop-ups:** Instagram presents a cookie consent dialog and, after login, prompts to save login info and turn on notifications. The bot handles these by finding buttons containing specific text (like "Not now") using a flexible XPath, as the exact selectors can be dynamic.
-   **Credentials:** The bot enters the username and password into the respective fields and submits the form to log in.

---

### 3. Step 2: Finding and Scrolling Through Followers
This was the most challenging part of the project.
-   **Accessing the List:** After logging in, the bot navigates directly to the followers page of the target account (e.g., `https://www.instagram.com/chefsteps/followers`).
-   **The Modal Pop-up:** The list of followers appears in a modal pop-up window. This list only shows a small number of followers initially; more are loaded as you scroll down *within the modal itself*.
-   **Executing JavaScript for Scrolling:** A standard Selenium scroll won't work here. The solution was to use `driver.execute_script()`. I located the modal element and then passed it into a JavaScript command that sets the modal's `scrollTop` to its `scrollHeight`, effectively scrolling it to the bottom. This was repeated in a loop to load hundreds of followers.

```javascript
// The JavaScript executed by Selenium
"arguments[0].scrollTop = arguments[0].scrollHeight"
```

---

### 4. Step 3: Following and Handling Exceptions
With the list of followers loaded, the final step was to iterate through them and click "Follow".
-   **Finding Buttons:** The bot selects all the "Follow" buttons within the modal.
-   **The Loop:** It then loops through each button and clicks it, with a short `time.sleep()` to appear more human and avoid being rate-limited.
-   **Exception Handling:** What if the bot tries to follow an account that is *already* being followed? Instagram will show a confirmation pop-up asking to "Unfollow". This action covers the next "Follow" button, leading to an `ElementClickInterceptedException`. The `try...except` block catches this, finds the "Cancel" button on the unfollow pop-up, clicks it, and continues to the next person in the list.
