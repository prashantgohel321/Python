# Day 36: Stock Trading News Alert Project

Welcome to my log for Day 36! Today's project was my most complex API integration yet: building a stock news monitoring service. The goal was to create a Python script that tracks a specific stock (like Tesla), detects significant price changes (e.g., more than 5% in a day), and then automatically fetches and sends the top 3 related news articles to my phone via SMS. It was a fantastic exercise in problem decomposition and API orchestration.

### 1. Project Overview & Problem Decomposition
This project was a "build-it-yourself" challenge. The first and most crucial step was breaking down the large, complex goal into a series of smaller, solvable problems.

**My Step-by-Step Plan:**
1.  **Get Stock Prices:** Fetch yesterday's and the day-before-yesterday's closing stock prices for a specific company (e.g., TESLA).
2.  **Calculate Difference:** Find the percentage difference between these two prices.
3.  **Set a Trigger:** If the percentage difference is above a certain threshold (I used 5%), proceed to the next step.
4.  **Get News:** If triggered, fetch the top 3 most recent news articles related to the company.
5.  **Format and Send:** Format the news headlines and descriptions into readable SMS messages and send them using Twilio.

### 2. Fetching Stock Data with Alpha Vantage
To get the stock data, I used the Alpha Vantage API, which provides free access to historical and real-time stock market data.

-   **Authentication:** I signed up for a free API key, which was required for all requests.
-   **API Call:** I made a `GET` request to the `TIME_SERIES_DAILY` endpoint.
-   **Parameters:** My request included three parameters:
    -   `function`: Set to `TIME_SERIES_DAILY`.
    -   `symbol`: The stock ticker I was interested in (e.g., `TSLA`).
    -   `apikey`: My unique API key.
-   **Data Parsing:** The JSON response was a nested dictionary. I used a list comprehension to convert the time-series data into a list, making it easy to access yesterday's data at `[0]` and the day-before's data at `[1]`.

---

### 3. Calculating the Percentage Change
Once I had the closing prices for both days, the calculation was straightforward.

-   **Find the Difference:** I subtracted the two closing prices and used the `abs()` function to get the positive difference.
-   **Calculate Percentage:** `(difference / yesterday_closing_price) * 100`
-   **Conditional Trigger:** An `if` statement checks if this percentage is greater than my threshold (e.g., `if diff_percent > 5:`). The rest of the code only runs if this condition is met.

---

### 4. Fetching Relevant News with the News API
When the price change was significant, the script needed to find out why by fetching the news.

-   **API Call:** I used the News API's `everything` endpoint.
-   **Parameters:** The key parameters were:
    -   `qInTitle`: I searched for the company name in the article title to ensure relevance.
    -   `apiKey`: My unique News API key.
-   **Slicing the Results:** The API can return many articles. I used Python's list slicing (`articles[:3]`) to grab only the first three articles from the list returned by the API.

---

### 5. Sending Formatted SMS Alerts with Twilio
The final step was to format the collected information and send it to my phone.

-   **Message Formatting:** I created a list of formatted strings. Each string included an up/down emoji (ðŸ”º or ðŸ”») based on whether the price difference was positive or negative, the stock symbol, the percentage change, and the headline and brief of one of the top three articles.
-   **Sending the SMS:** I looped through my list of three formatted article strings and sent each one as a separate SMS using the Twilio client.
