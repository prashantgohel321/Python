# Day 28: Building a GUI Pomodoro Timer with Tkinter

Welcome to my log for Day 28! Today's project was to build a fully functional desktop application from scratch: a Pomodoro Timer. This was a fantastic exercise in creating a more dynamic GUI using **Tkinter**. I learned how to use the `Canvas` widget to layer images and text, a crucial skill for more complex interfaces. I also tackled the important concept of handling time-based events in a GUI without freezing the program, and implemented the complete logic for the Pomodoro Technique.

### 1. The Tkinter Canvas Widget
The `Canvas` is one of Tkinter's most powerful widgets. Unlike simpler widgets that just hold one thing (like a label or a button), the canvas is like a real artist's canvas, allowing me to place and layer multiple elements on top of each other.

-   **Creating a Canvas:** I initialized it just like any other widget, specifying a width and height.
-   **Placing an Image:** To put the tomato image on the canvas, I first had to load it using `tkinter.PhotoImage`. Then, I used `canvas.create_image()` to place it at a specific (x, y) coordinate on the canvas.
-   **Layering Text:** To place the timer text *on top* of the image, I used `canvas.create_text()`. This method also takes x and y coordinates, along with arguments for the text content, font, and color.
-   **Updating Canvas Items:** A key learning point was that to change an item on the canvas (like the timer text), I need to use the `canvas.itemconfig()` method, passing it the ID of the item I want to change and the new configuration (e.g., `text="new text"`).

### 2. Handling Time and Countdowns in a GUI
A major challenge in any GUI programming is dealing with time. A simple `while` loop with a `time.sleep()` call will freeze the entire application, because it blocks the `mainloop()` from listening to user events.

-   **Event-Driven Programming:** GUIs are "event-driven." They sit in a `mainloop`, constantly listening for events (like button clicks). Blocking this loop makes the app unresponsive.
-   **The `.after()` Method:** Tkinter provides a brilliant solution with the `window.after()` method. It works by scheduling a function to be called after a specified delay (in milliseconds) *without* blocking the mainloop.
-   **Creating a Recursive Loop:** I created the countdown effect by having my `count_down()` function call `window.after()` on itself.

    ```python
    def count_down(count):
        # ... update the UI with the count ...
        if count > 0:
            window.after(1000, count_down, count - 1) # Wait 1 sec, then call itself with a decremented count
    ```
-   **Cancelling the Timer:** I also learned to use `window.after_cancel()` to stop the scheduled function call, which was essential for the "Reset" button functionality. This required storing the ID returned by `window.after()` in a variable.

---

### 3. Python's Dynamic Typing
During this project, I encountered a practical example of Python's **dynamic typing**. To format the timer display correctly (e.g., showing "05" instead of "5"), I needed to conditionally change the data type of my seconds variable.

-   If the `count_sec` was an integer less than 10, I could reassign it to a formatted **string** like `f"0{count_sec}"`.
-   Python allows a variable's type to change during runtime, which is not possible in statically-typed languages like C++ or Java. While powerful, it's something to be mindful of.

### 4. Project: The Pomodoro Timer
The goal was to create a desktop app to help with the Pomodoro productivity technique (25 min work, 5 min break, with a longer break after 4 work sessions).

-   **My Process:**
    1.  **UI Setup:** I created the main window, used a `Canvas` to display the tomato image and the timer text. I added the "Timer" label, "Start" and "Reset" buttons, and a label for checkmarks, arranging everything with the `.grid()` layout manager.
    2.  **Timer Logic:** I implemented the `count_down()` function using `window.after()` to handle the second-by-second countdown and update the text on the canvas.
    3.  **Pomodoro Cycle:** The `start_timer()` function was the brain of the app. It tracked the number of repetitions (`reps`) to determine whether the next session should be a work period, a short break, or a long break, and then started the `count_down()` with the correct duration.
    4.  **Reset Mechanism:** The `reset_timer()` function was connected to the reset button. It used `window.after_cancel()` to stop the timer, reset the timer text and title, and cleared the checkmarks.
    5.  **User Feedback:** The UI provides clear feedback by changing the title label to "Work" or "Break" (with different colors) and adding a checkmark for each completed work session.
