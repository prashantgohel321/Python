# Day 40: Capstone Project - Flight Deal Finder (Part 2)

Welcome to my log for Day 40! This is the exciting conclusion to the Flight Deal Finder capstone project. Today, I leveled up the personal tool from yesterday into a full-fledged service capable of managing and notifying multiple users. The "Flight Club" is now open for business! It can sign up new members, find more complex flight routes, and automatically email the best deals to everyone on the list.

### 1. From Personal Tool to Multi-User Service
The main goal today was to scale the application. Instead of sending an SMS only to myself, the program needed to handle a list of users, find deals relevant to them, and send out mass email notifications. This required adding a user management component and upgrading the notification system.

---

### 2. Step 1: Creating a User Sign-Up System
To get users into the system without building a full web application, I used a clever and efficient workaround:

-   **Google Forms:** I created a simple Google Form to act as the sign-up page. It collects the user's First Name, Last Name, and Email.
-   **Linking to Google Sheets:** I linked the form to my existing "Flight Deals" Google Sheet. This automatically created a new sheet tab named "users" and populates it with every new sign-up. This is a fantastic "low-code" approach to user registration.

---

### 3. Step 2: Finding Flights with Stopovers
The original flight search was limited to direct flights, which meant missing out on many potential deals, especially for long-haul destinations. I upgraded the search logic to be more comprehensive:

-   **Two-Phase Search:** The `FlightSearch` class now performs a search for direct flights first.
-   **Fallback Search:** If no direct flights are found for a destination, it automatically triggers a second search for flights with one stopover.
-   **Updated Data Model:** I updated the `FlightData` class to include a `stops` attribute, allowing me to track and report whether a flight is direct or has stopovers.

---

### 4. Step 3: Managing and Retrieving User Data
With user data now flowing into the Google Sheet, I needed a way to access it.

-   **Updated DataManager:** I modified the `DataManager` class to handle the new "users" sheet.
-   **`get_customer_emails()` Method:** I added a new method that makes a `GET` request to the Sheety endpoint for the "users" sheet. It then parses the JSON response and returns a simple list of all registered customer email addresses.

---

### 5. Step 4: Emailing Deals to All Club Members
This was the final piece of the puzzle, turning the notification system into a broadcast tool.

-   **From SMS to Email:** I refactored the `NotificationManager` to send emails instead of SMS messages.
-   **`send_emails()` Method:** This new method uses Python's built-in `smtplib` library. When the main script finds a cheap flight, it now calls this method.
-   **Mass Emailing:** The method takes the flight deal message and the list of customer emails (from `DataManager`) as input. It then iterates through the list, sending a formatted email alert to every single user in the club. I also had to handle character encoding (`.encode('utf-8')`) to ensure symbols like `Â£` were transmitted correctly.

Here is the complete, final code for all modules of the Flight Club project.
